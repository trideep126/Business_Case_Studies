## 🎯 Business Impact

| Metric | Value | Business Significance |
|--------|-------|---------------------|
| **Annual Net Benefit** | $4.7M | Direct bottom-line impact |
| **Charge-off Rate** | 3.58% | Just above the industry benchmark (2.5%) |
| **Processing Automation** | 85% | Reduced manual underwriting |
| **False Rejection Reduction** | 15% | Captured additional revenue |

## Technical Architecture

### Data Pipeline
- **Dataset**: Nearly 150,000 credit applications
- **Features**: 16 risk variables (interest rate, income, DTI, etc.)
- **Preprocessing**: Mean imputation, Feature Scaling, Feature engineering
- **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation with stability testing

### Model Performance
```
CatBoost Ensemble Results:
├── Accuracy: 94%
